# LOGICAL OPERATORS
###LIKE This allows you to perform operations similar to using WHERE and =, but for cases when you might not know exactly what you are looking for.

###IN This allows you to perform operations similar to using WHERE and =, but for more than one condition.

###NOT This is used with IN and LIKE to select all of the rows NOT LIKE or NOT IN a certain condition.

###AND & BETWEEN These allow you to combine operations where all combined conditions must be true.

###OR This allows you to combine operations where at least one of the combined conditions must be true.
