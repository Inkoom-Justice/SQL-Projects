### This file contains the basics of SQL
### I am using the Parch and Posey Database

Note: SQL STATEMENT 
      1. A piece of correctly written SQL code
      2. A way to manipulate data stored in a database
      3. A sentence
      4. A way to read data stored in a database.
      
      NB: SQL commands are called QUERIES/QUERY

#SELECT AND FROM
###SELECT indicates which column(s) you want to be given the data for.
###FROM specifies from which table(s) you want to select the columns. Notice the columns need to exist in this table.

#### HOW TO SELECT DATA WITH ALL COLUMNS FROM A DATABASE
SELECT * 
FROM orders

### HOW TO SELECT DATA (orders) WITH SOME COLUMNS (id, account_id, occurred_at) FROM A DATABASE
SELECT id, account_id, occurred_at
FROM orders


# LIMIT
###LIMIT statement is useful when you want to see just the first few rows of a table.
###This can be much faster for loading than if we load the entire dataset.
SELECT *
FROM orders
LIMIT 10;

SELECT *
FROM web_events
LIMIT 100000;

SELECT occurred_at, account_id, channel
FROM web_events
LIMIT 15;

# ORDER BY
###The ORDER BY statement allows us to sort our results using the data in any column.
SELECT id, occurred_at, total_amt_usd
FROM orders
ORDER BY occurred_at
LIMIT 10;

SELECT id, account_id, total_amt_usd
FROM orders
ORDER BY total_amt_usd DESC 
LIMIT 5;

SELECT id, account_id, total_amt_usd
FROM orders
ORDER BY total_amt_usd
LIMIT 20;

SELECT id, account_id, total_amt_usd
FROM orders
ORDER BY account_id, total_amt_usd DESC;

SELECT id, account_id, total_amt_usd
FROM orders
ORDER BY total_amt_usd DESC, account_id;

# WHERE
###Using the WHERE statement, we can display subsets of tables based on conditions that must be met.
SELECT *
FROM orders
WHERE account_id = 4251
ORDER BY occurred_at
LIMIT 1000;

SELECT *
FROM orders
WHERE gloss_amt_usd >= 1000
LIMIT 5;

SELECT *
FROM orders
WHERE total_amt_usd < 500
LIMIT 10;

SELECT *
FROM accounts
WHERE name = 'United Technologies'

SELECT *
FROM accounts
WHERE name != 'United Technologies'

SELECT name, website, primary_poc
FROM accounts
WHERE name = 'Exxon Mobil';

# AS
### The AS command can be used to name new columns in SQL. It is mostly used to name a new column after an arithmetic operation.

### ARITHMETIC OPERATORS
    1. ADDITION
    2. SUBTRACTION
    3. MULTIPLICATION
    4. DIVISION

SELECT account_id,
       occurred_at,
       standard_qty,
       gloss_qty + poster_qty AS nonstandard_qty
FROM orders

SELECT id, account_id, standard_amt_usd/standard_qty AS unit_price
FROM orders
LIMIT 10;

SELECT id, account_id, 
poster_amt_usd/(standard_amt_usd + gloss_amt_usd + poster_amt_usd) AS post_per
FROM orders
LIMIT 10;
